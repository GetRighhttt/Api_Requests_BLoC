# Api Request in BLoC.
Practicing the BLoC pattern to handle state and events.
Used jsonplaceholder to mimic making two different api calls. One on the main
screen and the other when the floating action button is clicked.<br>
Also used method channels to get the battery life of android devices, however code is commented when first running the app.
